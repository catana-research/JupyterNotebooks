    "- ```auto``` - C++11 introduces  type inference capability using the auto keyword, which means that the compiler infer the type of a variable at the point of declaration.\n",
    "- ```nullptr``` - The constant 0 has had the double role of constant integer and null pointer constant.C++11 corrects this by introducing a new keyword to serve as a distinguished null pointer ```constant:nulptr```\n",
    "- ```shared_ptr``` - Stores a pointer to a dynamically allocated object, the object pointed to is guaranteed to be deleted when the last shared_ptr pointing to it is destroyed or reset. \n",
    "- ```enum class``` - “Traditional” enums in C++ export their enumerators in the surrounding scope ,which can lead to name collisions, if two different enums in the same have scope define enumerators with the same name,\n",
    "C++11 introduces the  ```enum class```  keywords. They no longer export their enumerators in the surrounding scope. Moreover we can also now inherit from an enum.\n",
    "- ```static_assert``` - Tests assertions at compile-time.\n",
    "- Variadic template - Variadic template is a template, which can take an arbitrary number of template arguments of any type. Both the classes & functions can be variadic.\n",
    "- Range-based for loops\n",
    "- Initializer lists\n",
    "- ```noexcept```\n",

    "- Lambda\n",
    "- Explicitly defaulted and deleted special member functions\n",
    "- override identifier\n",
    "- ```std::thread``` - A thread class (std::thread) is provided which takes a function object — and an optional series of arguments to pass to it — to run in the new thread."
