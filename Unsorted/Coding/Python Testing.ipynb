    "## Guidelines\n",
    "\n",
    "- A testing unit should focus on one tiny bit of functionality and prove it correct.\n",
    "- Each test unit must be _atomic_: fully independent, be able to run alone and function regardless of the order that they are called. The implication of this rule is that each test must be loaded with a fresh dataset and may have to do some cleanup afterwards. This is usually handled by ```setUp()``` and ```tearDown()``` methods.\n",
    "- Try hard to make tests that run fast. If one single test needs more than a few milliseconds to run, development will be slowed down or the tests will not be run as often as is desirable. Use mocking or keep heavier tests in a separate test suite that is run by some scheduled task, and run all other tests as often as needed.\n",
    "- Learn your tools and learn how to run a single test or a test case. Then, when developing a function inside a module, run this function’s tests frequently, ideally automatically when you save the code.\n",
    "- Always run the full test suite before a coding session, and run it again after. This will give you more confidence that you did not break anything in the rest of the code.\n",
    "- It is a good idea to implement a hook that runs all tests before pushing code to a shared repository.\n",
    "- The first step when you are debugging your code is to write a new test pinpointing the bug, bug catching tests are among the most valuable pieces of code in your project.\n",
    "- Use long and descriptive names for testing functions.\n",
    "- When resolving errors or changing behaviors, the testing code will be read as much as or even more than the running code. A unit test whose purpose is unclear is not very helpful in this case.\n",
    "\n",
    "In summary, a good test is (https://late.am/post/2015/04/20/good-test-bad-test.html):\n",
    "- Fast\n",
    "- Selective - One test per test case, helps to diagnose what in particular failed.\n",
    "- Repeatable\n",
    "- Reliable \n",
    "- Helpful"
